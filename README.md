## 🎨 Gradient Algorithms

### Linear Mode
- Bilinear interpolation between four corners
- Blended with center color based on distance from canvas center

### Radial Mode
- Distance-based fade from center to edge
- Edge colors interpolated by angle (smooth 360° color wheel)
- Power curve (`dist^1.5`) for enhanced center focus
